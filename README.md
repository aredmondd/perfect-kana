## What is Kana?
>"Kana are syllabaries used to write Japanese phonoligcal units, morae."
~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana  <br>

Kana references hiragana and katakana (generally) which make up the Japanese 'alphabet' to form words and phrases.

**Hiragana**: Commonly used Kana system used in Japanese <br>
**Katakana**: Angular form of kana used in Japanese (primarly for words of foreign origin) <br>
**Kanji** (not used in perfect kana): Logographic Chinese characters representing entire words <br>
**Romaji**: Romanized spelling used to write Japanese Language (か = ka) <br>

**Dakuten**: Dakuten is a diacritic mark that indicates a consonant should be pronounced differently (か vs が) <br>
**Handakuten**: Handakuten is a (different) diacritic mark that indicates a consonant should be pronounced differently (は vs ぱ) <br>
